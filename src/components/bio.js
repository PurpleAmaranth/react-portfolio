          Hello! I'm Tiffany Lovett a Coding Entrepreneur and 
          Engineering Student. I grew up in the Foster Care System 
          in Southern California and spent many a day dreaming about 
          how to give back to other At-Risk Children. I plan to establish
           an adventurous career in the STEM Field as a Tech Visionary and
            to share my experiences from projects like those I have 
            completed with NASA in Aerospace Engineering with other 
            hopeful yet disadvantaged students.
