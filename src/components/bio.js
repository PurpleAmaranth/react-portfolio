            Hello! I'm Tiffany Lovett a coding entrepreneur and engineering student. I grew up in the foster care system in Southern California and spent many a day dreaming about how to give back to other at-risk children. I plan to establish an adventurous career in the STEM field as a tech visionary and to share my experiences from projects like those I have completed with NASA in aerospace engineering with other hopeful yet disadvantaged students.
